  Abstract                 = {With increasing cost for power generation opportunities for small scale power generation from waste heat have increased. The awareness of untapped resources such as local waste heat streams as well as the available range of technology and products to harvest such streams is increasing steadily though field data is scarce for applications below 100Â Â°C entry temperature. \{ORC\} applications have a large number of open parameters and therefore require field data for correlation of models. This paper presents field data and analysis of an \{ORC\} power generation plant operating with NH3. The unit operates on waste heat from a Swedish pulp mill at an available temperature of 75 to 85Â Â°C. Performance at varying heat source conditions and capacity is reported as well as an analysis of the particular investment case. The data was generated during a 15 day period and show a thermal efficiency of 8â€“9% at capacities from 50 to 100%. The results indicate a flat thermal efficiency from 20 to 100% capacity. Investment case analysis is based on a purchase model while the chosen economic model is a supplier own-and-operate arrangement supplying the mill with power at a predefined cost during an extended period of time.},

  Abstract                 = {Low temperature power cycles can benefit from the use of multi-phase flow expansion devices from a thermodynamic cycle efficiency point of view. Particularly power cycles such as ORC, Kalina and Trilateral Flash Cycles can be improved by multi-phase expansion. This article presents the experimental findings in a series of laboratory tests on a semihermetic Lysholm Turbine operating with \{R134a\} with superheated, saturated and wet inlet gas conditions. The test arrangements are described as well as discussion on the relevance of such test data. Finally comparison is made with findings from other investigations and recommendations for further studies are made. A correlation between peak efficiency and sensitivity to inlet vapour fraction was discovered which allows for estimations of adiabatic efficiencies with 2-phase inlet conditions even when only test data, or simulations, from single phase inlet conditions exist. The conclusions made are that Lysholm Turbines are well suited for low temperature power generation and that further understanding of the performance during 2-phase conditions is required.},

The experimental databank, from numerous independent research studies, is then utilized to develop the new prediction methods to evaluate local heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops. These new methods were developed from 1903 heat transfer and 1513 frictional pressure drop data points (3416 total), respectively, and were proved to work better over a very wide range of operating conditions, plate designs and fluids (including ammonia). The prediction for flow boiling heat transfer coefficients was broken down into separate macro- and micro-scale methods.},

Specifically, in Part 1, a description of the complex geometry of plate heat exchangers and an introduction to their major applications is described, followed by an extensive literature survey of experimental studies and associated prediction methods.

  Abstract                 = {We present a generic methodology for organic Rankine cycle optimization, where the working fluid is included as an optimization parameter, in order to maximize the net power output of the cycle. The method is applied on two optimization cases with hot fluid inlet temperatures at 120 Â°C and 90 Â°C. Pure fluids and mixtures are compared to see how mixed working fluids affect performance and important design parameters. The results indicate that mixed working fluids can increase the net power output of the cycle, while reducing the pressure levels. The maximum net power output is obtained by fluids with a critical temperature close to half of the hot fluid inlet temperature. For some mixtures we find the maximum net power when the temperature glide of condensation matches the temperature increase of the cooling water, while for other mixtures there are large differences between these two parameters. Ethane is a fluid that obtains a large net power increase when used in mixtures. Compared to pure ethane, an optimized ethane/propane mixture attains a 12.9{\%} net power increase when the hot fluid inlet temperature is 120 Â°C and a 11.1{\%} net power increase when the hot fluid inlet temperature is 90 Â°C. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic models of vapor compression systems are useful tools in developing feedback controllers and are gaining increasing attention in recent years. The dominant dynamics are typically those of the evaporator and condenser, which are difficult to model. Accuracy and execution speed of system models therefore are highly dependent on the modeling approach of the heat exchangers. The two common approaches are the finite-volume (FV) and the moving-boundary (MB) methods. Both have been used successfully and reported in the literature, but there is little discussion presented for either choice. This paper presents the development and comparative study of shell-and-tube heat exchanger dynamic models using both the FV and the MB approaches. Detailed model formulations are provided and stability is demonstrated as components and within a complete centrifugal chiller system model. The system models are validated using data from a 300 kW R134a centrifugal chiller test stand. The FV formulation is found to be more robust through start-up and all load-change transients, but executes slower. The moving-boundary method can handle all load-change transients but start-up stability is more sensitive to compressor and expansion valve formulations. The moving-boundary formulation also executes about three times faster than the finite-volume while maintaining nearly identical accuracy. With the homogenous two-phase assumption, charge prediction is seen to be less accurate in the moving-boundary approach. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd and IIR.},

When it comes to advanced control strategies, not only accurate but fast dynamic models are required. Moving boundary models are fast low-order dynamic models, and they can describe the dynamic behavior with high accuracy. This paper presents a mathematical formulation based on physical principles for two-phase flow moving boundary evaporator and condenser models which support dynamic switching between all possible flow configurations. The models were implemented in a library using the equation-based object-oriented Modelica language. Several integrity tests in steady-state and transient predictions together with stability tests verified the models. Experimental data from a direct steam generation parabolic-trough solar thermal power plant is used to validate and compare the developed moving boundary models against finite volume models.},

  Abstract                 = {Solar thermal electricity technologies are attractive alternatives to produce electricity by means of a renewable source. One of these technologies is parabolic trough collectors. In Spain, the sale of solar electricity to the national grid is primed. There are three main parameters that affect the behaviour of these plants: area of solar collector field, capacity of thermal storage tanks and power of the auxiliary system. In this paper, a simplified model of the plant is used to optimize the size of its components that produces the maximum yearly profit. The use of traditional methods of optimization is not possible and genetic algorithms have been used. An important feature of the model is that the minimum level of the electricity production of the block of power can be fixed. Once the optimization has been performed, the traditional parameters that characterize the dimension of the plant are analysed (the solar multiple and the capacity factor). For a gross power of 50 MW, the optimum collector area varies between 583,000 m2 and 749,860 m2 with a thermal storage between 6.55 h and 13.46 h respectively. The economic benefit is always higher than 19.30 Mâ‚¬ per year and the cost of the electricity produced is about 18.5 câ‚¬/kWh. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Arizona Public Service (APS) is currently installing and operating new power facilities to generate a portion of its electricity from solar resources that will satisfy its obligation under the Arizona Environmental Portfolio Standard. During FY04, APS began construction on a 1-MWe parabolic trough concentrating solar power plant. Site preparation and construction activities continued throughout FY05 and early FY06. Construction was completed and initial startup occurred by the end of December 2005. Full power production and initial performance monitoring and evaluation will occur early in 2006. This project is the first commercial deployment of parabolic trough collector technology developed by Solargenix Energy, Inc. of Raleigh, North Carolina. The plant, located near Red Rock, Arizona, uses an organic Rankine cycle power plant by Ormat, which is much simpler than conventional steam Rankine cycles and allows unattended operation of the facility. APS has teamed with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories (collectively called SunLab), along with Nexant, Inc. to support design and startup activities and performance assessment. SunLab has developed TRNSYS models of the plant and will utilize initial performance baseline data to validate the models. Eventually, those models will be used to determine whether a proposed thermocline energy storage system designed by Nexant, Inc. is technically and economically feasible for this plant. SunLab has also assisted APS with development of an O&M database using the Maximo system to track solar plant costs and component failure modes. Copyright Ã‚Â© 2006 by ASME.},

  Abstract                 = {The feasibility of energy storage is of paramount importance for solar power systems, to the point that it can be the technology enabler. Regarding concentrated solar power (CSP) systems, the implementation of thermal energy storage (TES) is arguably a key advantage over systems based on photovoltaic (PV) technologies. The interest for highly efficient and modular CSP plants of small to medium capacity (5kWE-5MWE) is growing: organic Rankine cycle (ORC) power systems stand out in terms of efficiency, reliability and cost-effectiveness in such power-range. In this paper a thorough investigation on thermal storage systems tailored to high-temperature (â‰ˆ300Â°C) ORC power plants is addressed first, stemming from the observation that the direct storage of the ORC working fluid is effective thanks to its favourable thermodynamic properties. The concept of complete flashing cycle (CFC) is then introduced as a mean of achieving an unmatched system layout simplification, while preserving conversion efficiency. This is a new variant of the Rankine cycle, whereby the vapour is produced by throttling the organic working fluid from liquid to saturated vapour conditions. The presentation and discussion of a case study follows: a 100kWE CFC system with direct thermal energy storage, coupled with state-of-the-art parabolic trough collectors. The proposed turbogenerator achieves an estimated 25{\%} efficiency, which corresponds to a value of 18{\%} in design conditions for the complete system. Considering siloxanes as working fluids, the estimated values of storage density are around 10kWeh/mstorage3. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this paper, a dynamic modeling software for energy systems called SimECS, which is currently under development at the Delft University of Technology, is described and validated. SimECS follows a modular, hierarchical and causal paradigm, e.g., systems are formed by components which in turn are formed by modules with predefined causal interactions. A description of various available modules is presented in the first part of this work, while a description of the components forming a steam cycle is given in the second part. The equations implemented in the modules follow from physical relations and conservation laws in the lumped parameters form. Bilateral coupling in combination with the causality principle are applied to obtain a solving system of algebraic and differential equations (DAEs) characterized by a low index. The concepts and their implementation into software are validated by comparison with measured data coming from a laboratory scale steam cycle setup (evaporating section of a waste heat recovery boiler with a power scaling factor of 1:600). This setup was built and operated at the Department of Electronics and IT of the Politecnico di Milano and experimental data are made publicly available on the internet. Both steady state and dynamic experiments are used for validation and simulation results show satisfying agreement with the experiments. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The present method gains power, scope, and speed by avoiding redundancies among the fluid properties, which otherwise lead to intolerable and unhelpful complexity of analysis and to a confusing multiplicity of correlations that look different but are often numerically rather similar. The chapter examines existing correlations, finding a reason for the fact that they are often numerically similar, despite using very different properties that leads to the improved method of analysis. It has always required a major effort of data reduction to compare experimental data with correlations that involve many properties. Comparisons between competing claims of different correlations are confused by uncertainties and indeed errors in tabulated property values, especially for uncommon fluids or old tabulations. These problems are greatly reduced by using a simpler correlation for example, in terms of reduced pressure, where the only tabulated property required for each fluid is critical pressure. The chapter concludes that taking advantage of that simplicity, correlations of a more subtle type can be considered without undue labor in data reduction.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the results of an experimental study carried out with R-134a during flow boiling in a horizontal tube of 2.6mm ID. The experimental tests included (i) heat fluxes in the range from 10 to 100kW/m2, (ii) the refrigerant mass velocities set to the discrete values in the range of 240â€“930kg/(m2s) and (iii) saturation temperature of 12 and 22Â°C. The study analyzed the heat transfer, through the local heat transfer coefficient along of flow, and pressure drop, under the variation of these different parameters. It was possible to observe the significant influence of heat flux in the heat transfer coefficient and mass velocity in the pressure drop, besides the effects of saturation temperature. In the low quality region, it was possible to observe a significant influence of heat flux on the heat transfer coefficient. In the high vapor quality region, for high mass velocities, this influence tended to vanish, and the coefficient decreased. The influence of mass velocity in the heat transfer coefficient was detected in most tests for a threshold value of vapor quality, which was higher as the heat flux increased. For higher heat flux the heat transfer coefficient was nearly independent of mass velocity. The frictional pressure drop increased with the increase in vapor quality and mass velocity. Predictive models for heat transfer coefficient in mini channels were evaluated and the calculated coefficient agreed well with measured data within a range 35{\%} for saturation temperature of 22Â°C. These results extend the ranges of heat fluxes and mass velocities beyond values available in literature, and add a substantial contribution to the comprehension of boiling heat transfer phenomena inside mini channels.},

  Abstract                 = {With the increasing concern for the environment over the last decades, in particular related to climate change, several initiatives from governments and public institutions have gone some way to improving the uptake of renewable energy sources as a viable alternative to traditional energy sources, such as coal and oil. In addition, energy security concerns are pushing governments of various countries to include renewable sources in their national energy portfolios. Spanish government has taken appropriate initiatives to formulate feed-in tariff laws to promote renewable energy plants. Since the publication of the last Spanish RD 661/2007, thermo solar energy plants are considered and several projects are under construction and someone in operation. These Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plants produce electricity by converting solar energy into high temperature heat using diverse mirror configurations. The heat is then used to produce electricity through a conventional generator system using turbine. Currently, research is undertaken on various CSP technologies for varying levels of high temperature generation capabilities and the storage of thermal energy to increase the number of operation hours of the CSP plants. Actually, most of the CSP projects under constructions employ the cylindrical-parabolic system. It consists of trough-shaped mirror reflectors to concentrate solar radiation on to receiver tubes containing thermal transfer fluid which is heated to produce steam. The ABANTIA and COMSA EMTEVenice 2010, Third International Symposium on Energy from Biomass and Waste industrial groups have decided to implement one of these CSP configurations with an additional innovative solution: the hybridization of CSP plant with biomass fueled boilers. The aim of this solution is to reach a higher electric production, a major stability in the operation of the thermal system and a higher renewable output of the plant.},

  Abstract                 = {Several dynamic models of concentrated solar power plants were developed. The component models used belong to the ThermoSysPro (Modelica-based) library developed by EDF and released under open source license. The main objective of ThermoSysPro is to provide a generic library for the modeling and simulation of power plants and other kinds of energy systems. The meaning of the word 'generic' is here to be understood as the possibility to use the same components to model different kinds of energy systems (thermal, nuclear, solar, etc.) for different types of studies (design, control system verification, etc.). To that end, the library contains over 200 0D/1D models of components such as heat exchangers, steam and gas turbines, compressors, pumps, drums, tanks, volumes, valves, pipes, furnaces, combustion chambers, linear parabolic trough solar collector, linear Fresnel reflector, solar field and heliostat, etc. In particular, one and two-phase water/steam flow, one phase oil flow, as well as flue gases flow are handled. The library has been validated against several test-cases belonging to all the main domains of power plant modeling, namely the nuclear, thermal, biomass and solar domains. The paper describes the structure of the library. Then the test-cases belonging to the solar domain (both solar and power cycle performance are modelled) are presented: a dynamic model of a Linear Parabolic Trough Solar power plant and a model of a Solar Hybrid Combined-Cycle Power Plant with a Linear Fresnel Field. Several transients are simulated, the objective being to reduce the uncertainty of the prediction on the yearly electricity production (simulation with yearly DNI). ?? 2013 The Authors.},

  Abstract                 = {This report describes the development, validation, and use of a heat transfer model implemented in Engineering Equation Solver (EES). The model determines the performance of a parabolic trough solar collector's linear receiver, also called a heat collector element (HCE). All heat transfer and thermodynamic equations, optical properties, and parameters used in the model are discussed. The modeling assumptions and limitations are also discussed, along with recommendations for model improvement. The model was implemented in EES in four different versions. Two versions were developed for conducting HCE design and parameter studies, and two versions were developed for verifying the model and evaluating field test data. One- and two-dimensional energy balances were used in the codes, where appropriate. Each version of the codes is discussed briefly, which includes discussing the relevant EES diagram windows, parameter tables, and lookup tables. Detailed EES software instructions are not included; however, references are provided. Model verification and a design and parameter study to demonstrate the model versatility are also presented. The model was verified by comparing the field test versions of the EES codes with HCE experimental results. The design and parameter study includes numerous charts showing HCE performance trends based on different design and parameter inputs. Based on the design and parameter study, suggestions for HCE and trough improvements and further studies are given. The HCE performance software model compared well with experimental results and provided numerous HCE design insights from the design and parameter study. The two design versions of the EES codes of the HCE performance model are provided in the appendix.},

The performance of the cycle is studied by means of a method introduced in previous papers which consists of assessing the goodness of a calculation method by looking at representative variables such as the evaporation or the condensation temperature depending on the case evaluated. This procedure is also used to compare several heat transfer coefficients in the refrigerant side. As in previous works the models of all the cycle components are considered together with the heat exchanger models in such a way that the system of equations they provide is solved by means of a Newtonâ€“Raphson algorithm. Calculated and measured values of the evaporation and the condensation temperatures are also compared. The experimental results correspond to the same air-to-water heat pump studied in other papers and they have been obtained by using refrigerants R-22 and R-290.},

In California, existing regulations require significant increases in renewable generation, as well as identification of customer-side Distributed Energy Resources (DER) controls, communication technologies, and standards for interconnection with the electric grid systems. As DER deployment expands, customer-side DER control and optimization will be critical for system flexibility and demand response (DR) participation, which improves the economic viability of DER systems. Current DER systems integration and communication challenges include leveraging the existing DER and DR technology and systems infrastructure, and enabling optimized cost, energy and carbon choices for customers to deploy interoperable grid transactions and renewable energy systems at scale.This paper presents a cost-effective solution to these challenges by exploring communication technologies and information models for DER system integration and interoperability. This system uses open standards and optimization models for resource planning based on dynamic-pricing notifications and autonomous operations within various domains of the smart grid energy system. It identifies architectures and customer engagement strategies in dynamic DR pricing transactions to generate feedback information models for load flexibility, load profiles, and participation schedules. The models are tested at a real site in California-Fort Hunter Liggett (FHL). The results for FHL show that the model fits within the existing and new DR business models and networked systems for transactive energy concepts. Integrated energy systems, communication networks, and modeling tools that coordinate supply-side networks and DER will enable electric grid system operators to use DER for grid transactions in an integrated system.},

  Abstract                 = {Experiments on the evaporative heat transfer and pressure drop in the brazed plate heat exchangers were performed with refrigerants R410A and R22. The plate heat exchangers with different 45??, 35??, and 20?? chevron angles are used. Varying the mass flux of refrigerant (13-34 kg/m2s), the evaporating temperature (5, 10 and 15 ??C), the vapor quality (0.9-0.15) and heat flux (2.5, 5.5 and 8.5 kW/m2), the evaporation heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops were measured. The heat transfer coefficient increases with increasing vapor quality and decreasing evaporating temperature at a given mass flux in all plate heat exchangers. The pressure drop increases with increasing mass flux and quality and with decreasing evaporating temperature and chevron angle. It is found that the heat transfer coefficients of R410A are larger than those of R22 and the pressure drops of R410A are less than those of R22. The empirical correlations of Nusselt number and friction factor are suggested for the tested PHEs. The deviations between correlations and experimental data are within ??25{\%} for Nusselt number and ??15{\%} for friction factor. ?? 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}There is evidence of ice melt, sea level rise to +5â€“9 m, and extreme storms in the prior interglacial period that was less than 1 Â°C warmer than today. Human-made climate forcing is stronger and more rapid than paleo forcings, but much can be learned by combining insights from paleoclimate, climate modeling, and on-going observations. We argue that ice sheets in contact with the ocean are vulnerable to non-linear disintegration in response to ocean warming, and we posit that ice sheet mass loss can be approximated by a doubling time up to sea level rise of at least several meters. Doubling times of 10, 20 or 40 years yield sea level rise of several meters in 50, 100 or 200 years. Paleoclimate data reveal that subsurface ocean warming causes ice shelf melt and ice sheet discharge. Our climate model exposes amplifying feedbacks in the Southern Ocean that slow Antarctic bottom water formation and increase ocean temperature near ice shelf grounding lines, while cooling the surface ocean and increasing sea ice cover and water column stability. Ocean surface cooling, in the North Atlantic as well as the Southern Ocean, increases tropospheric horizontal temperature gradients, eddy kinetic energy and baroclinicity, which drive more powerful storms. We focus attention on the Southern Ocean's role in affecting atmospheric CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} amount, which in turn is a tight control knob on global climate. The millennial (500â€“2000 year) time scale of deep ocean ventilation affects the time scale for natural CO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} change, thus the time scale for paleo global climate, ice sheet and sea level changes. This millennial carbon cycle time scale should not be misinterpreted as the ice sheet time scale for response to a rapid human-made climate forcing. Recent ice sheet melt rates have a doubling time near the lower end of the 10â€“40 year range. We conclude that 2 Â°C global warming above the preindustrial level, which would spur more ice shelf melt, is highly dangerous. Earth's energy imbalance, which must be eliminated to stabilize climate, provides a crucial metric.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Series and parallel circuits of an Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) and an additional heat generation were compared by second law analysis. Depending on operating parameters criteria for the choice of the working fluid were identified. The results show that due to a combined heat and power generation, the second law efficiency of a geothermal power plant can be significantly increased in comparison to a power generation. The most efficient concept is a series circuit with an organic working fluid that shows high critical temperatures like isopentane. For parallel circuits and for power generation, fluids like R227ea with low critical temperatures are to be preferred. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  Abstract                 = {The world is moving towards a crucial climate change meeting in Paris in December 2015 (COP21). The negotiations there will be based on national pledges, formally known as Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, with the goal of setting the world on a sustainable path. The International Energy Agency has long emphasised to its members and the world at large that energy production and use which is not compatible with international environmental requirements is not sustainable: it fails the test of energy security. The IEA, therefore, feels an obligation to make a contribution to COP21 â€“ a contribution which reconciles climate and energy needs. That is the purpose of this special report in the World Energy Outlook series. The report: Presents a detailed first assessment of the energy sector impact of known and signalled national climate pledges for COP21. Proposes a bridging strategy to deliver a near-term peak in global energy-related greenhouse-gas emissions, based on five pragmatic measures that can advance climate goals through the energy sector without blunting economic growth. Highlights the urgent need to accelerate the development of emerging technologies that are, ultimately, essential to transforming the global energy system into one that is consistent with the world's climate goals. Recommends four key pillars on which COP21 can build success, from an energy sector perspective.},

Qualities ranging from sub-cooled liquid to superheated vapor were investigated. Mass fluxes ranged from 16 kg/m2 s (for superheated vapor) to approximately 300 kg/m2 s (for sub-cooled liquid). The pressure drop experiments were conducted for 10 ??C and 20 ??C inlet temperatures. A two-phase pressure drop model, based on the kinetic energy of the flow, was developed in order to relate the two-phase pressure drop data to the single-phase data.

  Abstract                 = {The applications of Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) appear to be growing in the field of waste heat utilization. This thermodynamic cycle can be successfully used in the field of biomass combustion, geothermal systems or solar desalination systems, providing efficient systems. In the last years, a very intense investigation on the utilization of low temperature waste heat for supplying ORC systems has brought new research potential in the area of thermodynamic optimisation of this cycle. More specifically, the use of supercritical fluid parameters in the ORC processes seems to become more and more attractive leading to lower exergy destruction systems together with higher heat utilization systems. However, the investigation of the heat exchanger design and the heat exchange coefficients is of high importance for these applications as the effective heat transfer reflects on the overall process energetic and exergetic efficiency. It is important to study the relatively unknown heat transfer mechanisms around the critical point to improve both the heat exchanger surface and the design algorithms. The aim of this paper is to investigate the influence of the ORC parameters on the heat exchanger design. More specifically, the basic parameters of the design of the heat exchangers will be defined in the cases of supercritical fluid parameters and the convective coefficients as well as resulting heat transfer surface will be calculated for various fluid parameters.},

Experimental heat transfer and pressure drop data are obtained for two phase evaporation of ammonia in a commercial plate heat exchanger for symmetric 30Â°/30Â° chevron plates. The plate heat exchanger was configured in a single pass U-type counter flow arrangement with liquid ammonia evaporating in upward flow direction and glycol/water solution simulating the heat load in counter flow. Experiments were carried out for saturation temperatures ranging from âˆ’25Â Â°C to âˆ’2Â Â°C. The heat flux was varied between 21Â kWÂ mâˆ’2 and 44Â kWÂ mâˆ’2. Experimental results show significant effect of saturation temperature, heat and exit vapor quality on heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop. Two phase Nusselt number and friction factor correlations are proposed.},

Even given these and other extraordinary statistics, public acceptance of human induced climate change and confidence in the supporting science has declined since 2007. The degree of uncertainty as to whether observed climate changes are due to human activity or are part of natural systems fluctuations remains a major stumbling block to effective adaptation action and risk management. Previous approaches to attribute change include qualitative expert-assessment approaches such as used in \{IPCC\} reports and use of â€˜fingerprintingâ€™ methods based on global climate models. Here we develop an alternative approach which provides a rigorous probabilistic statistical assessment of the link between observed climate changes and human activities in a way that can inform formal climate risk assessment. We construct and validate a time series model of anomalous global temperatures to June 2010, using rates of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as other causal factors including solar radiation, volcanic forcing and the El NiÃ±o Southern Oscillation. When the effect of \{GHGs\} is removed, bootstrap simulation of the model reveals that there is less than a one in one hundred thousand chance of observing an unbroken sequence of 304&#xa0;months (our analysis extends to June 2010) with mean surface temperature exceeding the 20th century average. We also show that one would expect a far greater number of short periods of falling global temperatures (as observed since 1998) if climate change was not occurring. This approach to assessing probabilities of human influence on global temperature could be transferred to other climate variables and extremes allowing enhanced formal risk assessment of climate change. },

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the experimental heat transfer coefficients and pressure drop measured during HFC refrigerant 134a, 410A and 236fa vaporisation inside a small brazed plate heat exchanger: the effects of heat flux, refrigerant mass flux, saturation temperature, outlet conditions and fluid properties are investigated. The experimental results are reported in terms of refrigerant side heat transfer coefficients and frictional pressure drop. The heat transfer coefficients show great sensitivity to heat flux and outlet conditions and weak sensitivity to saturation temperature. The frictional pressure drop shows a linear dependence on the kinetic energy per unit volume of the refrigerant flow. HFC-410A shows heat transfer coefficients 40-50{\%} higher than HFC-134a and 50-60{\%} higher than HFC-236fa and frictional pressure drops 40-50{\%} lower than HFC-134a and 50-60{\%} lower than HFC-236fa. The experimental heat transfer coefficients are compared with two well-known equations for nucleate boiling [M.G.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The present work is focused on the thermodynamic optimization of organic Rankine cycles (ORCs) for power generation and \{CHP\} from different average heat source profiles (waste heat recovery, thermal oil for cogeneration and geothermal). The general goal is to provide optimization guidelines for a wide range of operating conditions, for subcritical and transcritical, regenerative and non-regenerative cycles. A parameter assessment of the main equipment in the cycle (expander, heat exchangers and feed pump) was also carried out. An optimization model of the \{ORC\} (available as an electronic annex) is proposed to predict the best cycle performance (subcritical or transcritical), in terms of its exergy efficiency, with different working fluids. The working fluids considered are those most commonly used in commercial \{ORC\} units (R134a, R245fa, Solkatherm, n-Pentane, Octamethyltrisiloxane and Toluene). The optimal working fluid and operating conditions from a purely thermodynamic approach are limited by the technological constraints of the expander, the heat exchangers and the feed pump. Hence, a complementary assessment of both approaches is more adequate to obtain some preliminary design guidelines for \{ORC\} units. },

It is the author's view that many important questions about the relation between mind and brain are of that second kind, and that some of the necessary technical and conceptual tools are becoming available as a result of work on the problems of making computer programs behave intelligently. We shall suggest a theory to explain why introspection does not give clear answers to these questions. Technical solutions to the questions will not be attempted, but there is probably some value in finding at least a clear explanation of why we are confused.},

In a single-pass U-type counterflow PHE, three different chevron plate arrangements are considered: two symmetric plate arrangements with beta = 30 deg/30 deg and 60 deg/ 60 deg, and one mixed-plate arrangement with beta = 30 deg/60 deg. For water(2 < Pr < 6) pow rates in the 600 < Re < 10(4) regime, data for Nu and f are presented. The results show significant effects of both the chevron angle beta and surface area enlargement factor phi. As beta increases, and compared to a pat-plate pack, up to two to five times higher Nu are obtained; the concomitant f, however, are 13 to 44 times higher. Increasing phi also has a similar, though smaller effect. Based on experimental data for Re less than or equal to 1000 and 30 deg less than or equal to beta less than or equal to 60 deg, predictive correlations of the form Nu = C-1(beta)D-1(phi) Re-P1(beta) Pr-1/3(mu/mu(w))(0.14) and f = C-2(beta)D-2(phi) Re-p2(beta) are devised. Finally, at constant pumping power, and depending upon Re, beta, and phi, the hear transfer is found to be enhanced by rep to 2.8 times that in an equivalent pat-plate channel.},

  Abstract                 = {Plate heat exchangers were first developed about 100 years ago but have won increasing interest during the last two decades, primarily due to the development of methods of manufacturing brazed plate heat exchangers. This type of heat exchanger offers very good heat transfer performance in single-phase flow as well as in evaporation and condensation. Part of the reason is the small hydraulic diameters, typically being less than 5 mm. Other advantages of plate heat exchangers are the extremely compact design and the efficient use of the construction material. In spite of their long use, the calculation methods for predicting heat transfer and pressure drop are not widely known. It is the purpose of this article to present such calculation methods for single-phase flow and for flow boiling and to discuss some of the specifics of this type of heat exchangers.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, the first concentrating solar power-biomass hybrid power plant commenced operation in Spain and the combination of both energy sources is promising to lower plant investment. This assessment investigates 17 different concentrating solar power-biomass hybrid configurations in regards their technical, economic and environmental performance. The integration of molten salt thermal storage is considered for the best performing hybrid configuration. While thermal storage can increase plant output significantly even 7. h full-load thermal storage plants would generate the majority of the electricity, 70{\%}, from the biomass resource.Only mature technologies with references {\textgreater}5. MWe are considered in this assessment to ensure that the scenarios are bankable. The concentrating solar power technologies selected are parabolic trough, Fresnel and solar tower while the biomass systems include grate, fluidised bed and gasification with producer gas use in a boiler.A case study approach based on the annual availability of 100,000. t of wood biomass is taken to compare the different plant configurations but the results are transferable to other locations when updating site and cost conditions. Results show that solar tower-biomass hybrids reach the highest net cycle efficiency, 32.9{\%}, but that Fresnel-biomass hybrids have the lowest specific investment, AU{\$} 4.5. m/MWe. The investment difference between the 17 scenarios is with up to 31{\%} significant. Based on the annual electricity generation CSP-biomass hybrids have an up to 69{\%} lower investment compared to standalone concentrating solar power systems. The scenario with the best technical performance, being solar tower and gasification, is at this point in time not necessarily the best commercial choice, being Fresnel and fluidised bed, as the lower Fresnel investment outweighs the additional electricity generation potential solar towers offer. However, other scenarios with different benefits rank closely. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {It is well understood that the cost of concentrating solar power (CSP) will need to decrease quickly to ensure competitiveness with photovoltaic (PV) systems and other forms of power generation. Research and development on CSP plant components is crucial in order to reduce costs but is typically time consuming. New CSP plant concepts combining proven technologies with CSP represent another option that can be implemented quickly. This paper investigates the use of several biomass materials to externally superheat steam in conventional parabolic trough plants. Currently, parabolic trough plants are easiest to finance and external steam superheating can overcome the lower efficiencies compared to other CSP technologies. Seven scenarios, each air and water cooled, with steam parameters ranging from 380 C at 100 bar to 540 C at 130 bar have been modeled, and the results presented here are based on a 50 MWe plant with 7.5 h molten salt thermal storage. Our results show that the peak solar to electricity net efficiency increases up to 10.5{\%} while the specific investment can decrease immediately from AU{\$}8.2m/MWe to AU{\$}6.3m/MWe, a 23.5{\%} reduction. That is significant considering the expected 17-40{\%} CSP cost reduction targets by the end of this decade. The modeling shows that even major fuel and water price changes are significantly less relevant than small changes in the agreed electricity purchase price. The technical, economic and environmental analysis reveals that external superheating with biomass can provide significant benefits, is able to use a variety of fuels and despite a limited global market, could immediately enable the implementation of several hundred MWe of CSP capacity at lower cost. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {This assessment aims to identify the most suitable concentrated solar power (CSP) technologies to hybridize with Rankine cycle power plants using conventional fuels, such as gas and coal, as well as non-conventional fuels, namely biomass and waste materials. The results derive from quantitative data, such as literature, industry information and own calculations, as well as qualitative data from an expert workshop. To incorporate the variety of technology criteria, quantitative and qualitative data the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) is used as the multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) tool. Only CSP technologies able to directly or indirectly generate steam are compared in regards to feasibility, risk, environmental impact and Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE). Different sub-criteria are chosen to consider the most relevant aspects. The study focuses on the suitability of CSP technologies for hybridisation and results obtained are reality checked by comparison with plants already being built/under construction. The results of this assessment are time dependant and may change with new CSP technologies maturing and prices decreasing in the future.Key findings of this assessment show that Fresnel systems seem to be the best technology for feedwater preheating, cold reheat steam and {\textless}450 ??C steam boost applications. Parabolic troughs using thermal oil rank second for all CSP integration scenarios with steam temperatures {\textless}380 ??C. Generally, for steam temperatures above 450 ??C the solar towers with direct steam generation score higher than solar towers using molten salt and the big dish technology. At and above 580 ??C the big dish is the only alternative to directly provide high pressure steam.In addition to a general CSP technology selection for hybridisation the framework of this study could be used to identify the most suitable CSP technology for a specific CSP hybrid project but this requires detailed information for direct normal irradiance, climate conditions, space constraints etc to provide reliable results. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the second part of the work concerning the dynamic simulation of small steam cycle plants for power generation. The work is part of the preliminary study for a 600 kWe biomass fired steam power plant for which the complete open-loop, lumped parameter dynamic model of the steam cycle has been developed using the SimECS software described in Part I of this work. For these low-power plants, a dynamic simulation tool is especially useful because these systems must be designed to operate in transient mode for most of the time. The plant model presented here consists of the following components: feedwater pump, economizer, evaporator, superheater, impulse turbine, electrical generator and condenser. The primary heat source is modeled as a flue gas flow and no combustion models are incorporated yet to model the furnace. A description of the various components forming the complete steam cycle is given to illustrate the capabilities and modularity of the developed modeling technique. The model is first validated quantitatively against steady-state values obtained using a well known, reliable steady-state process modeling software. Subsequently, the dynamic validation is presented. Results can only be discussed based on the qualitative assessment of the observed trends because measurements are not available, being the plant in the preliminary design phase. The qualitative validation is based on four dynamic simulations involving three small step disturbances of different magnitude imposed on the pump rotational speed and on the flue gas mass flow and a single large ramp disturbance on the flue gas mass flow. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This two-part article explores the dynamic behavior of a flash tank vapor injection heat pump system from a numerical simulation perspective. Part I provides a first-principles model describing the transient heat transfer and flow phenomena of the system with detailed modeling techniques for each component. The vapor injection scroll compressor is analyzed with the internal heat transfer between the refrigerant and metallic parts taken into account. Lumped-parameter models are developed for the flash tank and expansion devices. Heat exchangers are modeled using a finite volume approach and accounting for the complex tube circuitry. The separated flow model without interfacial exchange is utilized for two-phase flows in order to incorporate an appropriate void fraction model so that a more accurate prediction for refrigerant mass distribution can be achieved. The modular nature of the component models allows flexibility in the system configuration. Transient simulations are carried out for start-up and shut-down operations. A detailed comparison of model predictions against experimental data is presented in the companion paper. },

The first part describes the detailed modeling techniques for each component, and the second part describes the transient simulations that are carried out for the overall system under start-up and shut-down operations and presents the results. After comparing the predictions of the proposed model with the experimental data, it was concluded that the proposed model can adequately capture the transient heat transfer and flow phenomena of the system. The dynamic system response when subjected to a step change in the opening of the upper-stage \{EEV\} (electronic expansion valve) was also investigated. It was found that \{EEV\} opening has a significant impact on the system performance and the liquid level in the flash tank, but exhibits little effect on the suction pressure. These findings were corroborated through experiments. },

  Abstract                 = {The continual increases in global energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions call for more and more utilisation of sustainable energy sources, such as solar energy, biomass energy, and waste heat. Solar thermal energy, the heat of biomass combustion and waste heat may be used to drive a combined heat and power (CHP) system. In recent years, several micro-CHP systems with organic Rankine cycle (ORC) suitable for domestic applications (1â€“10Â kWe) driven by solar thermal, biomass-fired boilers and waste heat resources have been investigated. These ORC-based micro-CHP systems have lower operation pressures and temperatures compared to conventional steam-Rankine cycle \{CHP\} systems and hence safer for household applications. However, the lack of commercially available expanders applicable to ORC-based micro-CHP systems has hindered the development of these novel \{CHP\} systems. This paper summarizes the findings of the market research for the expanders and discusses the selection and choices of the expanders for ORC-based micro-CHP systems. The working principles and the characteristics of several kinds of expanders, including turbine expanders (i.e., turboexpander), screw expanders, scroll expanders and vane expanders, are introduced and evaluated. },

  Abstract                 = {Organic Rankine Cycles (ORCs) are particularly suitable for recovering energy from low-grade heat sources. This paper describes the behavior of a small-scale \{ORC\} used to recover energy from a variable flow rate and temperature waste heat source. A traditional static model is unable to predict transient behavior in a cycle with a varying thermal source, whereas this capability is essential for simulating an appropriate cycle control strategy during part-load operation and start and stop procedures. A dynamic model of the \{ORC\} is therefore proposed focusing specifically on the time-varying performance of the heat exchangers, the dynamics of the other components being of minor importance. Three different control strategies are proposed and compared. The simulation results show that a model predictive control strategy based on the steady-state optimization of the cycle under various conditions is the one showing the best results. },

  Abstract                 = {Recent interest in small-scale solar thermal combined heat and power (CHP) power systems has coincided with demand growth for distributed electricity supplies in areas poorly served by centralized power stations. One potential technical approach to meeting this demand is the parabolic trough solar thermal collector coupled with an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) heat engine. The paper describes the design of a solar organic Rankine cycle being installed in Lesotho for rural electrification purpose. The system consists of parabolic though collectors, a storages tank, and a small-scale \{ORC\} engine using scroll expanders. A model of each component is developed taking into account the main physical and mechanical phenomena occurring in the cycle and based on experimental data for the main key components. The model allows sizing the different components of the cycle and evaluates the performance of the system. Different working fluids are compared, and two different expansion machine configurations are simulated (single and double stage). },

  Abstract                 = {Converting waste heat to electricity using organic ranking cycle (ORC) technology is an effective method to improve energy efficiency and reduce cost. However, the waste heat source is often characterized by relatively large fluctuations in load, making it a demanding task to design and operate an ORC in an efficient and economically sound manner. A reliable performance prediction in an early project phase helps to create an economically successful operation and build the business case on a firm foundation. In this paper a prototype of such a prediction tool is presented. Amain emphasis lays on the control strategy that allows to reproduce part load behavior including autonomous shutdown and restart events. The suggested control strategy consist of two coupled layers, a state machine and a main controller operating different actuators. The state machine enables to switch between different control schemes, which is important for example for the transition of a running state to a shutdown procedure. The compiled ORC model simulates the electrical power output within two percent compared to measurements of the real application. The model was applied to a test run with generic boundary conditions for a time period of 30 days and showed its capabilities to autonomously and reliably shut down and restart to normal operations. 1.},

The fluids are alkanes, fluorinated alkanes, ethers and fluorinated ethers.

Thermal efficiencies ??
 th are presented for cycles of different types. In case of subcritical pressure processes one has to distinguish (1) whether the shape of the saturated vapour line in the T,s-diagram is bell-shaped or overhanging, and (2) whether the vapour entering the turbine is saturated or superheated. Moreover, in case that the vapour leaving the turbine is superheated, an internal heat exchanger (IHE) may be used. The highest ??
 th-values are obtained for the high boiling substances with overhanging saturated vapour line in subcritical processes with an IHE, e.g., for n-butane ??
 th=0.130. On the other hand, a pinch analysis for the heat transfer from the heat carrier with maximum temperature of 120 ??C to the working fluid shows that the largest amount of heat can be transferred to a supercritical fluid and the least to a high-boiling subcritical fluid. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Indeed, there are good reasons to believe Wilson-Plot techniques are superior to alternative data interpretation schemes. Unfortunately, Wilson-Plot methods are conceptually and computationally more complex than the other methods and it is not possible to simply extend the single-sample uncertainty analysis of Kline and McClintock to the modified Wilson-Plot technique. A rational approach to uncertainty analysis for the modified Wilson-Plot is not available in the literature, but if this methodâ€”accepted as superior to othersâ€”is to be widely adopted, a well-defined approach to uncertainty analysis is needed. The purpose of this paper is to provide an uncertainty analysis appropriate for the modified Wilson-Plot technique.},

  Abstract                 = {A detailed comparison of flow boiling heat transfer results in a stainless steel tube of 1.1 mm internal diameter with results of a three-zone flow model are presented in this paper. The working fluid is R134a. Other parameters were varied in the range: mass flux 100â€“600 kg/m2â€‰s; heat flux 16â€“150 kW/m2 and pressure 6â€“12 bar. The experimental results demonstrate that the heat transfer coefficient increases with heat flux and system pressure, but does not change with vapour quality when the quality is less than about 50{\%} for low heat and mass flux values. The effect of mass flux is observed to be insignificant. For vapour quality values greater than 50{\%} and at high heat flux values, the heat transfer coefficient does not depend on heat flux and decreases with vapour quality. This could be caused by dryout. The three-zone evaporation model predicts the experimental results fairly well, especially at relatively low pressure. However, the dryout region observed at high quality is highly over-predicted by the model. The sensitivity of the performance of the model to the three optimised parameters (confined bubble frequency, initial film thickness and end film thickness) and some preliminary investigation relating the critical film thickness for dryout to measured tube roughness are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {The production of electricity using concentrated solar power (CSP) technology is not yet possible in Brazil due to the technology's high capital costs and the lack of a local industry. However, this study introduces a low-cost approach to CSP in Brazil by describing and simulating the operation of hybrid CSP plants that use sustainably managed biomass in Brazil's semiarid northeast. Biomass hybridisation of a CSP plant with a solar multiple (SM) of 1.2 and a biomass fill fraction (BFF) of 30{\%} can generate electricity at 110USD/MWh. The high direct normal irradiation (DNI) and the availability of local low-cost biomass in Brazil's semiarid northeast suggest the possibility of developing a CSP industry capable of supplying low-cost components under a national program framework, with the co-benefits of local job and income generation. For example, the deployment of 10 CSP plants of 30MWe each would generate 760 direct and indirect jobs during the 24 months of plant construction and approximately 2100 annual jobs associated with the operation and maintenance (O{\&}M) of the generating units. These 10 new units would generate additional local income on the order of USD 57 million.},

Since 1950, the number of attempts to produce viable mechanical power from solar energy has increased enormously, their sizes ranging from a few watts to several megawatts and, because of their number, the size of devices reviewed has been limited to 100 kW. The design philosophies of the projects have been varied; some included technologies at the forefront of current developments to obtain maximum performance, while others attempted to employ simpler technologies at the expense of performance so as to provide devices suitable for construction and maintenance in less developed regions of the world. In this set of papers, the two philosophies have been distinguished as "conventional" (using modern technologies) and "unconventional" (using simpler technologies) in an attempt to examine each in an appropriate context. To assist those contemplating further investigations, the devices have also been categorised by their proposed source temperature and working medium. Since solar power is most likely to be employed in remoter regions in both developed and developing countries, the merits of devices have been reviewed in this light. This paper covers devices falling into the "conventional" category. ?? 1989.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper the results of the preliminary performance assessment of an emerging hybrid CHP-technology using Organic- Rankine-Cycle technology comprising biomass combustion and concentrating solar thermal power in areas with low DNI is presented. The study was conducted in course of the research project BIOconSOLAR, which was funded by the climate fund of the Austrian government. The assessment is based on the technical design and economic conditions of an existing CHP-plant with nominal electric power output of 1.5 MW, which is located in the city Salzburg in Austria. The solar thermal energy provided by a parabolic trough collector field is primary used for electric power production in order to reduce biomass consumption and operation costs accordingly, but also to boost the thermal energy supply for the district heating of the city Salzburg. For electric power production the solar thermal energy is fed into the ORC-power cycle at a temperature level of at least 270Â°C. A transient simulation model of both the biomass CHP-plant and the parabolic trough plant was developed in IPSEpro. Based on the results of the process simulation the economic performance was assessed by conducting a dynamic investment calculation. Despite the technical and economic uncertainties of this preliminary assessment the retrofitting of biomass-solar CHP-plants with CSP in areas with low DNI is a promising option to improve the economic performance of about 100 CHP-plants in operation in Central Europe. A feed-in-tariff for solar thermal electricity in the same order of magnitude as for photovoltaic could trigger the retrofit of biomass CHP-plants.},

  Abstract                 = {This article presents an outdoor test method to evaluate the optical and thermal performance of parabolic-trough collectors of large size (lengthâ‰¥100m), similar to those currently installed in solar thermal power plants. Optical performance in line-focus collectors is defined by three parameters, peak-optical efficiency and longitudinal and transversal incidence angle modifiers. In parabolic-troughs, the transversal incidence angle modifier is usually assumed equal to 1, and the incidence angle modifier is referred to the longitudinal incidence angle modifier, which is a factor less than or equal to 1 and must be quantified. These measurements are performed by operating the collector at low fluid temperatures for reducing heat losses. Thermal performance is measured during tests at various operating temperatures, which are defined within the working temperature range of the solar field, and for the condition of maximum optical response. Heat losses are measured from both the experiments performed to measure the overall efficiency and the experiments done by operating the collector to ensure that absorber pipes are not exposed to concentrated solar radiation. The set of parameters describing the performance of a parabolic-trough collector of large size has been measured following the test procedures proposed and explained in the article. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {The system mean void fraction model's principle virtue is its simplicity. The model converts the two-phase evaporating or condensing flow system into a type of lumped parameter system, generally yielding simple, closed form solutions in terms of the important system parameters. The particular applications of the model which are demonstrated in this paper are for a class of transient flow problems where complete vaporization or condensation takes place, and where the system mean void fraction can be considered to be time-invariant. This assumption uncouples the problem from the transient form of the momentum principle, an analytical simplification of considerable magnitude. The specific transients under consideration are caused by changes in the inlet flowrate. For evaporating flows, these transients are the effective liquid dry-out point, and the outlet flowrate of superheated vapor. For condensing flows, they are the effective point of complete condensation, and the outlet flowrate of subcooled liquid. ?? 1978.},

  Abstract                 = {An experimental refrigerant loop has been established in the present study to measure the condensation heat transfer coefficient hr and frictional pressure drop $\Delta$Pf of R-134a in a vertical plate heat exchanger. Two vertical counter flow channels were formed in the exchanger by three plates of commercialized geometry with a corrugated sinusoidal shape of a chevron angle of 60Â°. Downflow of the condensing R-134a in one channel releases heat to the cold upflow of water in the other channel. The effects of the refrigerant mass flux, average imposed heat flux, system pressure (saturated temperature) and vapor quality of R-134a on the measured data were explored in detail. The results indicate that at a higher vapor quality the condensation heat transfer coefficient and pressure drop are significantly higher. A rise in the refrigerant mass flux only causes a mild increase in the hr values for most cases. The corresponding rise in the $\Delta$Pf value is slightly larger. Furthermore, it is noted that the condensation heat transfer is only slightly better for a higher average imposed heat flux. But the associated rise in $\Delta$Pf is larger. Finally, at a higher system pressure the hr value is found to be slightly lower. But the effect of the system pressure on $\Delta$Pf is small. Correlations are also provided for the measured heat transfer coefficients and pressure drops in terms of the Nusselt number and friction factor.},

  Abstract                 = {A simulation consists of a triple of automata (system to be simulated, model of this system, computer realizing the model). In a valid simulation these elements are connected by behavior and structure preserving morphisms. Informational and complexity considerations motivate the development of structure preserving morphisms which can preserve not only global, but also local dynamic structure. A formalism for automaton structure assignment and the relevant weak and strong structure preserving morphisms are introduced. It is shown that these preservation notions properly refine the usual automaton homomorphism concepts. Sufficient conditions are given under which preservation of the local state space structure (weak morphism) also forces the preservation of component interaction. The strong sense in which these conditions are necessary is also demonstrated. This provides a rationale for making valid inferences about the local structure of a system when that of a behaviorally valid model is known.},

Various technologies have been suggested to exploit low-temperature thermal energy sources, otherwise difficult to access using conventional power generation systems. In this paper, the authors review the most recent advances and challenges for the exploitation of low grade thermal energy resources, with particular emphasis on \{ORC\} systems, based on information gathered from the technical literature. An outline of the issues related to \{ORC\} system modeling is also presented, and some guidelines drawn to develop an effective and powerful simulation tool. As a summary conclusion of the revised models, a simulation tool of an \{ORC\} system suitable for the exploitation of low grade thermal energy is introduced. },
